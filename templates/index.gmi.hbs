# {{name}} - Software Programmer

I am a Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience with developing a wide variety of performant and reliable
software across a range of platforms. Much of my work has been in production use serving a large number of users for
several years.

* Micro-service driven and distributed applications
* Web applications
* Desktop applications
* Mobile applications

I have also worked in teams with developers from all around the world and communicated and co-ordinated effectively to
reach common goals together.

In addition to being a productive software engineer, I also have significant experience with network provisioning and
management, and dev ops automation to ensure consistent delivery and performance of the products that I have developed
with my teams.

## ♊ Git on Gemini!

I have hosted my project repos with a UI made for Gemini.

=> gemini://git.ritesh.ch ♊ My Projects

So now my page has fewer links to the WWW!

## 🐧 Free-Software Projects

=> gemini://git.ritesh.ch/ritesh/gemini-git-browser.git ♊ Gemini Git Browser

A basic Gemini UI for browsing git repositories. Browsable branches, trees and viewable files. And like other HTTP Git UIs, it will render the README.md file in gemtext if it exists in your repo! :)

=> gemini://git.ritesh.ch/ritesh/deploy-scripts.git ♊ Deploy Scripts

A collection of shell scripts to automatically package and deploy software to a variety of targets like servers,
kubernetes or aws clusters, docker hosts, etc. It works similarly to capistrano but has fewer dependencies and supports
several stacks out-of-the-box like spring boot, ruby on rails, django, actix-web, etc.

=> gemini://git.ritesh.ch/ritesh/epp-rtk-java-extensions.git ♊ EPP RTK Java Extensions

A collection of EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol used by domain registries) Extensions for the EPP RTK Java library
which is used by Domain Registrars to register and manage domains.

=> gemini://git.ritesh.ch/ritesh/epp-rtk-java-extras.git ♊ EPP RTK Java extras

A collection of useful features for the EPP RTK Java library to make it easier to use with multiple domain registrar
backends on a single deployment.
